Description • 5 years ago
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120905151427

Steps to reproduce:

After years of using Thunderbird and adding new and new folders (199 .msf files in profile) Thunderbird started behaving erratically.


Actual results:

I have problems opening folders (not loading them, having to resync/repair them over IMAP). Thunderbird is saying that address book file is corrupted when I start it. Even after restoring to known working backup version same was happening.


Expected results:

Thunderbird should work normally even with large number of folders.

I have discovered that it is related to file limits in some way. My ulimit -n says "256", launchctl limit returns the same number.

If I run /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird terminal, everything works correctly. If I run Thunderbird from dock, it does not.

I replaced /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird with:

#!/bin/bash
ulimit -n 2048
exec /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-orig

And now also it works from Dock without problems for me. (I renamed original thunderbird binary to thunderbird-orig.)

Your reported this at version 15.
Does that mean you did not have trouble when using version 14?

and also please test beta 38 from http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/channel/ with ulimit left to default.  Is it better, worse?

OK. This was now a scary experience. After I run the beta, I saw in the Activity Manager one bunch of "Deleted folder" messages. Luckily, it seems it deleted it only locally, keeping the .msf file, but deleted the other file. They are still on the server. Running "Download/Sync Now" is restoring them now.

...

No, in fact "Download/Sync Now" does not help. It seems it is deleting files randomly, including .msf files, just to keep their count under 256. Doing "find . | wc -l" returns 246 files inside ImapMail folder. There should be around 300 files there. Also, when I start the program, I am still getting "Unable to Load Address Book File" error which is a reason how I discovered this bug.

Running my fixed version of the program immediately bumped the number of files in ImapMail directory to 335.

So I would say that with beta 38 it is the same. So Thunderbird having issues keeping up with the number of folders. And me having to constantly resync the ones which it loses track of.

I am not sure about this. I think it started happening when I added more folders. So it is not a regression. Just my use increased through time.

so syncing to fix was mentioned as "temporary fix" in comment 0. But that not helping is "new" behavior in 38, correct?

You mean by bumping ulimit?

Why do you have so low ulimit in your system? I think normally the number of open files is allowed in thousands (at least on other systems).
E.g. linux default seems to be 1024 (http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=0ac1ee0bfec2a4ad118f907ce586d0dfd8db7641)

But I wonder why TB actually opens so many files. I though the msf files are only opened by TB if the mail folder is accessed in TB (or mail downloaded to it, etc.).

Mitar, please paste the list of open files so we see those really are the .msf files for folders.

Wayne, rkent, we should watch this kind of problem as it could get worse thanks to bug 1135310 after which we potentially keep MORE files open (to actually have working DB caching). Even when disconnecting the DB file from the folder, the file handles are not released (bug unfiled yet) immediately. So if user manages to visit too many folders within the minute (or more until file handles are actually closed), he may hit the OS limit of open files. We could avoid this by implementing some system for refusing opening of more folder databases if we hit some pref based limit. But that could have consequences (e.g. TB thinking folder does not exist and starting some recovery action), better would be to close some older DB and open the new one.

The Mac default per process ulimit is 256.

user is probably seeing bug 495911, which is the oldest description of this issue.  AFAICT does not exist in version 2.x.  see  bug 495911 comment 108 and https://bug495911.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=752939 which is an example list of open files. See my most recent comments in the bug.

To have a long term fix we likely need a more general solution than adjusting how many files TB open. see bug 495911

Yeah, if the problem are font files, we can't help with that one. But limiting number of open folders could be useful nevertheless. E.g. mail.db.max_open does not really hard limit the number of open folders at peaks. It only closes them down after the 1 minute timer and then after undefined event.

Syncing does not really help. It makes some folders appear, but then some others disappear. It helps you get access to a folder, but then you loose some others.

533 are opened. It is at startup. With my ulimit increase this is possible. Later on (like 10 minutes after) number of file descriptors fall down. At this moment there are 234 files open.

interesting example.
389 msf
40 fonts (usually I've seen way more)
30 thunderbird profile
13 applications folders, including thunderbird 
63 other

Is the redaction causing that all the msf files have the same name? :)

Mitar (Reporter)	-
Comment 16 • 2 years ago
Yes, they do not have the same name otherwise.

Comment 17 • 2 years ago
OK, so I'll look at this if we can hard-limit the number of open databases.

Does the user have by any chance a search folder that searches over large numbers of folders? Search folders have to open all databases that they search.

Mitar (Reporter)	-
Comment 19 • 2 years ago
Hm, would not hard-limit slow down the startup?

No, I do not have search folders (at least if there are not some which are hidden/internal). But I do Spotlight indexing integration enabled.

Comment 20 • 2 years ago
I do not have anything special to cleanup files or something installed on my Mac. I have one IMAP account, one local account, and one RSS feeds account. 393 folders all together (this is also the number of .msf files).

Also running Thunderbird in the safe mode (no extensions) still has the same Address Book issue and lsof | wc -l returns at one sample more than 373 filehandles. And this is without my ulimit changing thing. So I am not sure how is this even possible? If the ulimit is 256, how can it still open more files? Anyway, things do not work. So it is not an extension.

Maybe, but at least it would not produce errors when opening folders or ABs. Which may cause dataloss.

Maybe some of those files are not counted against the limit. Some system files or something.

Bug 717574 (confirmed NEW) appears to be the same issue.

To work around this bug, I launch Thunderbird from a shell function 'ulimit -S -n 512; /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-bin'.

I implemented the 'ulimit -S -n 512; /Applications/Thunderbird.app/Contents/MacOS/thunderbird-bin' suggestion. Once the user was trained to using a different icon to start TB (not re-open), the display settings have been stable.

If only a developer could do the same...
