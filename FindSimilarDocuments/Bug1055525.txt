Add-Header-Padding-FTE.jpg

Currently, the FTE setup flow screens are very full and feel like a daunting wall of text. This is because all of the content is close together. By simply adding some breathing room and separation between content, the UX can improve drastically and the actions required will become more obvious.

We can do this by simply adding padding above and below header text. So there's more space between status bar and header and more space between body content and header. Each screen would be much easier to read and understand, and we wouldn't lose any copy or row of content on most screens.

***

If we can't move the header down, can we at least push the body content down by triple so there's more separation between the title and body content?
